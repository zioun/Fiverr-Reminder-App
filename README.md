# Fiverr Account Reminder Application

This application serves as a reminder to load your Fiverr account every 4 minutes. It features an alert system and a countdown timer that displays the remaining time until the next alert.

## Features

- **Periodic Alerts**: A notification pops up every 4 minutes to remind you to load your Fiverr account.
- **Countdown Timer**: A real-time timer counts down from 4 minutes, showing the remaining time for the next alert.
- **Customizable Alert Message**: The alert message reminds you to check your Fiverr account.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface to monitor the timer.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the application interface.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the timer functionality and alert system.

## How It Works

1. The application initializes a countdown timer set to 4 minutes (240 seconds).
2. As the timer progresses, it updates the UI to show the remaining time.
3. Once the timer reaches zero, an alert message is displayed.
4. The timer automatically resets and starts counting down again.
